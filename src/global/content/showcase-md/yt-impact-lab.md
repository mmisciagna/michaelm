### Overview

Targeting non-profits, YouTube Impact Lab's mission is to harness YouTube's scale, technology and talent to ignite and sustain movements that drive measurable social change.

### Goal
Provide a hub for non-profits who want to work with YouTube where they can find general information and showcase some success stories and campaigns and to help non-profits register for the program.

### Challenges

Because the site is static (i.e. no means of collecting or receiving user data), having them register on the site would not be practical. Instead, we provided a quiz-styled walkthrough that determines whether or not the user is qualified to register for the YouTube Impact Lab program based on their provided answers.

If the user is qualified, or is lacking just a few steps, then the walkthrough will direct you to the proper places to fullfill those steps and complete the registration process.

If the user is not qualified, they may provide their email to be contacted later and resources are provided that explain how to get qualified before they can register.
