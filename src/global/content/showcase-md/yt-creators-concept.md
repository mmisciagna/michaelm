### Hero
I removed the carousel in favor of an image of a popular YouTube Creator. Mulitples [studies](https://shouldiuseacarousel.com/) have shown that carousels are ineffective for displaying content because most ignore anything after the first frame.

The copy states exactly what this site is — a resource hub for YouTube creators — with clear calls to action.

### Social Feeds

Instead of making the user interact with more carousels to view the social feeds, I displayed them in plain sight. The exception is the Twitter feed which is a carousel but in "ticker tape" style (i.e. it will scroll across the page automatically).

### Sitemap

The homepage contains a sitemap in that it displays all available pages on the YouTube Creators site. Nothing is hidden.
