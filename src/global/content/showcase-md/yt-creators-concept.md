### Hero
To enhance the effectiveness of the website, I replaced the carousel with an image of a popular YouTube Creator, as multiple [studies](https://shouldiuseacarousel.com/) have indicated that carousels are not efficient for displaying content, with most users ignoring any frames after the first one.

Additionally, I ensured that the website's copy clearly conveys its purpose as a comprehensive resource hub for YouTube creators, with easily discernible calls to action

### Social Feeds

Rather than requiring users to navigate through additional carousels to view the social feeds, I made them readily visible on the page. However, the Twitter feed is still presented as a carousel, albeit in a "ticker tape" format that scrolls across the page automatically.

### Sitemap

The homepage features a sitemap that displays all available pages on the YouTube Creators site, ensuring that nothing is hidden from the users.
