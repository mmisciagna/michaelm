### Overview

The YouTube Creators site is a resource hub for all YouTube creators, whether they are just getting starting or already have 1,000,000+ subscribers. There they'll find video tutorials, contest sign ups, the latest news from the Creators social feeds and general information on how to optimize their YouTube Channel.

### Challenges

Historically, user retention had not been very good on the YouTube Creators site. When a pool of Creators were asked about this, it turned out that the navigation was hidden and when you did find it, the labels were not descriptive. For instance, NextUp is a series of contest where creators can, "Learn to create better videos, get more subscribers and take your channel to the next level...", but they didn't know that just by looking at the navigation. To remedy this, we made the navigation more descriptive. Now a user wanting to learn, would know to look under the "Learn and Connect" tab where they'd find NextUp. These tabs are plainly visible and fixed to the top of the viewport.

This version of the YouTube Creators site took on an ambitious goal â€” to combine mulitple sites into one. Each site having they're own navigation made this particularly difficult since that meant they're needed to be 3 layers of navigation: 1) homepage tabs, 2) pages 3) those pages' navigation. To solve this issue, we added a second row to the header on the individual pages to hold the page navigation while adding a "Main Menu" to the top row that allows creators to navigate to to any other page on the YouTube Creators site.

The previous version of the YouTube Creators site had many links that drove away from the site. This, obviously, decreased retention. For this version, we included the YTCreators Twitter feed, blog and latest videos right on the homepage; keeping them on the site for longer sessions.
