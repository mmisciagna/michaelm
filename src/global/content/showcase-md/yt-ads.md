## Overview

The website aims to provide information to prospective YouTube Advertisers, offering guidance on the initial steps, creating ads, and identifying relevant channels and target audiences.

## Goal

Reduce potential advertisers' apprehension about advertising on YouTube by providing a step-by-step guide, leading them to the Google Ads workflow and ultimately increasing conversions.

## Challenges

To ensure optimal performance, this website undergoes continual testing to refine its workflow. Multiple A/B tests are conducted for different designs and workflows to determine the most effective approach.

Moreover, we incorporated tracking from the YouTube Ads website to Google Ads by adding sub-ids, UTMs, and other data to the URL. The value of these parameters varies depending on the users' origin, whether from a clicked ad campaign or an organic search from a search engine, and must persist as the user navigates the site. To pass on data to Google Ads, I utilized the browser's local storage to store the necessary information.

## Leadership

Continuous iteration and refinement were necessary for this website, requiring both A/B testing and tracking from one product to another. After completing the initial build, I oversaw our engineering vendor to manage the site while also contributing to the codebase.
