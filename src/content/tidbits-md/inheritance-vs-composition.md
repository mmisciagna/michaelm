It's worth knowing the difference between _Inheritance_ and _Composition_ in JavaScript. There's a time and place for both, and knowing which one to use will make your code more effecient and scalable.

This video below explains the differences pretty well, but I disagree that you should stop using _Inheritance_ altogether. This <a href="https://javascript.plainenglish.io/inheritance-is-a-vs-composition-has-a-in-javascript-98fb96dfa0e6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a> gives a use case for both _Inheritance_ and _Composition_.
