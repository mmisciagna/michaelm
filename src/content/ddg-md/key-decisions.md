Most of the stakeholders lacked experience in building websites, especially for Google, which follows a particular process. Our team was generally the first one they interacted with before anything was put to paper, therefore, a lot of the key decisions came down to our expertise. For <a href="https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/" target="_blank">How YouTube Works</a>, I was shown rough wireframes, and it was apparent that the stakeholders did not anticipate the same issues as me, particularly with scalability. Each page was unique and who knows how many would be added in the future.

I knew that the answer would be a design solution as well as an engineering one. I made sure I was involved in every design review with the agency and worked with them to come up with a solution that utilized templated designs, with some custom variations. This whittled the unique pages from dozens to just three or four. This allowed new content to be added and/or maintained quickly and drastically shortened the dev timeline.
