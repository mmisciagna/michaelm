The stakeholders involved in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/" target="_blank">How YouTube Works</a> had no idea how to launch a website. We were the experts, so we took it upon ourselves to not only be the engineers but teachers. We wrote pages of documentation and walked them through getting approvals from privacy and security to legal reviews. We took part in every design review to consult and give our general feedback and ideas.  From ideation through implementation and maintenance we would work with everyone: project managers, agencies, UX researchers, privacy experts, SEO experts, vendors, and even lawyers.

The process could be like herding cats. To help wrangle everything, we tried to minimize the number of communication channels. As much as possible, we kept all communication in a single Technical Design Doc (TDD). It included a sitemap, links to Figma files and other docs, locales, timeline, etc... All information was kept in one place to ensure everyone was on the same page.
