My rule of thumb for a frontend engineering timeline is two days per page, depending on the complexity. This is based on experience, so much so, that I was able to create a spreadsheet that took the number of pages, assigned a value based on the complexity for each page, and gave a good estimate of how many business days it would take to build the project from design handoff to launch.

Now, the engineering of each page is not the only task to account for. Feedback from stakeholders, QA, accessibility, localization, time to resolve any feedback, and some buffer time were also included in the tally. Too many times had we been given a project that was in design for months but only given a few weeks to develop. This timeline template spreadsheet gave the stakeholders a clear understanding of how long it may takeâ€¦ usually eight to ten weeks or more. Of course, there would be compromises and tasks done in tangent to help facilitate and shorten the timeline when necessary.

For <a href="https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/" target="_blank">How YouTube Works</a>, using a templated design approach and launching in English only while content was being localized helped to drastically shorten the timeline.
