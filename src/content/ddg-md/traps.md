The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/" target="_blank">How YouTube Works</a> project quickly became bloated with the number of pages and dozens of locales each page was localized into. This made maintaining the site tedious because building the site for production would take a long time.

I was naive to think that stakeholders would stick to the templated designs for each subpage. Stakeholders with different priorities saw the success of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/" target="_blank">How YouTube Works</a> and started coming to us with concepts like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/intl/en_us/howyoutubeworks/progress-impact/impact/us-of-youtube/" target="_blank">US of YouTube</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/intl/en_us/howyoutubeworks/progress-impact/impact/creator-economy/" target="_blank">Creator Economy</a> that derive from no templates. At that point, I was building sites within a site, further bloating the project with disparate code.
