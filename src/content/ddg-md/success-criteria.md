<a href="https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/" target="_blank">How YouTube Works</a> is the sort of site that requires messaging to be on point and on time, so streamlining the process from making updates, adding new pages, to localization was crucial. The idea was that YouTube would have a way to respond to something quickly â€” COVID-19 for example. The stakeholders could add content to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/" target="_blank">How YouTube Works</a> with little oversight from an engineering team. This site was not meant to increase conversions, but rather to inform and to build user trust. The success criteria was:

1. Does it make it easy for users to find the information they are looking for?
1. Can stakeholders create, read, update and/or delete (CRUD) content on the site for quick responses?

In those two regards, I believe we succeeded.
