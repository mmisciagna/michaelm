After falling into this trap of adding more and more disparate code into one projectâ€™s repo, we started breaking up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/" target="_blank">How YouTube Works</a> into separate repos and created a header component specific to this site in our library. That way if we needed to add or remove a page, it would reflect in the header for all projects in the new repos.
