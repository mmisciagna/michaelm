### Overview

The YouTube Creators website serves as a valuable information center for creators of all levels on YouTube, regardless of whether they're beginners or have already amassed over 1,000,000 subscribers. It offers a variety of resources, such as instructional videos, contest registration, up-to-date announcements from the Creators' social media channels, and comprehensive guidance on enhancing their YouTube channels.

### Challenges

In the past, user retention on the YouTube Creators site was subpar, and a survey of creators revealed that the site's navigation was not easily accessible or clearly labeled. To address this issue, we revamped the navigation, making it more descriptive and visible. The tabs are now prominently displayed and affixed to the top of the viewport, making it easier for users to find what they're looking for.

This iteration of the YouTube Creators site aimed to consolidate multiple sites into a single platform, which presented a significant challenge due to each site having its own navigation system, resulting in a three-layered navigation structure: homepage tabs, pages, and page navigation. To overcome this obstacle, we added a second row to the header on individual pages to house the page navigation, while the top row features a "Main Menu" that enables creators to navigate to any page on the YouTube Creators site.

Previously, the YouTube Creators site had many outbound links that led users away from the site, resulting in reduced retention rates. To address this issue, we added the YTCreators Twitter feed, blog, and latest videos to the homepage, keeping users engaged on the site for more extended periods.
