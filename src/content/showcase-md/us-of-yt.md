## Overview

This website features an entertaining and engaging map of the United States, which allows users to explore notable YouTube Creators in each state.

## Challenges

The servers can identify the users' country but cannot provide more specific location data such as the state. To overcome this, we discovered an internal API on within Google Cloud that allowed us to access and modify it to suit our requirements. With this update, the "U.S. of YouTube" site can now automatically detect the user's state and provide customized content accordingly.
