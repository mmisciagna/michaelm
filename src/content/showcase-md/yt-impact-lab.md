### Overview

The YouTube Impact Lab is aimed at non-profit organizations and is dedicated to utilizing YouTube's vast reach, cutting-edge technology, and talented creators to initiate and maintain campaigns that lead to quantifiable social impact.

### Goal
The YouTube Impact Lab serves as a central platform for non-profit organizations seeking to collaborate with YouTube. It provides general information, showcases success stories and campaigns, and helps non-profits register for the program.

### Challenges

As the website is static, it is not feasible for users to register on the site. Therefore, we created a quiz-like walkthrough that assesses the user's eligibility for the YouTube Impact Lab program based on their responses.

If the user qualifies or only requires a few additional steps to complete the registration process, the walkthrough will direct them to the appropriate resources to fulfill those requirements and complete the registration process.

If the user does not meet the criteria for qualification, they can provide their email address to be contacted later, and resources are provided to guide them on how to become eligible to register for the program.
