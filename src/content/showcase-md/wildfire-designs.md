## Wildfire Interactive

These are a collection of designs I created during my stint at _Wildfire Interactive_, (2011â€“2012). There we crafted marketing websites and brand campaigns for a diverse clientele including Fortune 500 companies. It was a fast-paced work environment and took creative problem-solving skills that resulted in a $350M Google acquisition in 2012.
